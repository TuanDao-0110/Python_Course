# 1.Multiple commands written in succession will be executed in order from first to last. For example this program


print("Welcome to Introduction to Programming!")
print("First we will practice using the print command.")
print("This program prints three lines of text on the screen.")


# 2. Fix the code: Seven Brothers
# "Seitsemän veljestä" is one of the first novels ever written in Finnish. It is the story of seven orphaned brothers learning to make their way in the world (read more on Wikipedia).

# This program is supposed to print out the names of the brothers in alphabetical order, but it's not working quite right yet. Please fix the program so that the names are printed in the correct order.

# print("Simeoni")
# print("Juhani")
# print("Eero")
# print("Lauri")
# print("Aapo")
# print("Tuomas")
# print("Timo")


# Fix the code
print("Aapo")
print("Eero")
print("Juhani")
print("Lauri")
print("Simeoni")
print("Timo")
print("Tuomas")
# 3. Please write a program which prints out the following lines exactly as they are written here, punctuation and all:

print ('Row, row, row your boat,')
print ('Gently down the stream.')
print ('Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,')
print ('Life is but a dream.')

# 4. Arithmetic operations
print('Arithmetic operations')
print(2 + 5)
print(3 * 3)
print(2 + 2 * 10)

# 5.Commenting 
print("Hours in a year:")
# there are 365 days in a year and 24 hours in each day
print(365*24)
# 6. Print some code
# Please write a program which prints out the following:

# Sample output
# print("Hello there!")

print('print("Hello there!")')
